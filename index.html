        <p>The beauty industry is a major market that has negatively impacted the health of our environment. While cosmetic products are an excellent way to show self-expression and act as a form of self-care, it is important to look at product ingredients and the sustainability behind a brand. While some clean beauty brands implement sustainable practices, some beauty brands do not, with some even greenwashing. Unfortunately, the beauty industry has contributed to large amounts of excessive packaging, unsustainable resource consumption, and plastic pollution- all of which can lead to environmental issues like climate change. According to TRVST, a platform for social justice, beauty packaging accounts for 120 billion units of trash each year. This includes paper, plastic, metals, and glass. As consumers, we must strive to make conscious and sustainable purchases, as our purchasing power can dictate the direction brands take toward cleaner practices. As for beauty brands, it is their responsibility to implement more sustainable practices with cleaner ingredients, for the health of consumers and our planet.</p>
